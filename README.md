# RPG-Dice-Roller
This is a simple desktop application to roll different amounts of multi-sided dice, using Python and Tkinter.  

This program takes input for the type of dice the user wishes to roll, and the amount of said dice to roll. Then, the program generates random numbers within the dice's range for each time they wish to roll the dice. Finally, the program adds the results together to display to the user. 

Example: If I wanted to roll 3 six-sided dice (3d6 in common RPG notation), I would put 6 in the "Sides of Dice:" field, and 3 in the "# of Dice:" field. The program then generates a random number between 1 and 6 three times, and adds the three generated numbers together. The program then shows the user the resulting total.
